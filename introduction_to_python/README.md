# Title

Udacity Bikeshare

## Description

In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States, Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answer questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
